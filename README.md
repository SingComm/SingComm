This project open source the data set used in the SingComm paper.

Two datasets were used in Experiment. 

I. Electical Store Dataset.

This experiment was performed using a laptop equipped with a high-end sound card, which collected data from roughly 100 types of electrical appliance in a home appliance market. 

Data collection was performed at three different days of different weeks, each of which involved collecting 2-minute acoustic traces sampled at 192kHz. 

The total dataset exceeded 10GB. 

II. Laboratory Dataset. 

Within a laboratory environment, we simultaneously collected data from 10 of the 100 home appliances using 4 mobile phones (iPhone 8, Ipad Pro 2018, OPPO R11, XiaoMi K20, 48kHz) as well as the above-mentioned sound card. Similarly, we collected traces in 2-minute sessions performed everyday at three different days of different weeks. 

All data can be downloaded for free.
